# jfrog-yocto CLI Plugin

## About this plugin
This plugin allows integrating Yocto builds to Jfrog platform.

#### What is Yocto?
The Yocto Project (YP) is an open source collaboration project that helps developers create custom Linux-based systems regardless of the hardware architecture.

The project provides a flexible set of tools and a space where embedded developers worldwide can share technologies, software stacks, configurations, and best practices that can be used to create tailored Linux images for embedded and IOT devices, or anywhere a customized Linux OS is needed.  

#### Why to use Jfrog platform with Yocto?
With the jfrog platform you can control the lifecycle and distribution of the IoT firmware 

#### How to use this plugin?
 This plugin will invoke the bitbake process and will then upload the build results to artifactory. 
 It features:
 * Easy integration with one command to invoke the full process
 * Ability to deploy the artifacts to Artifactory and scan with Xray 

This plugin supports the following options:
* One command, clean, build, deploy **[ default, no flags are required ]**
* Continue build after failure without clean **[ use flag --clean=false ]**
* Build externally, use plugin only to deploy the artifacts **[ use flag --build=false ]**
* Build only, do not deploy to RT afterwards **[ use flag --load=false ]** 

## Using with docker

Using it with docker make it easier.
The docker image is based on gmacario/build-yocto which provides all the build-in tools for yocto build.

### instructions:
    1. build the project
        CMD:  docker build -t jfrog-yocto-builder .
    2. git clone your yocto project src files to your local machine. 
        Example: git clone -b jethro git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
    3. Make sure you have a proper artifactory configururation on your running machine.
        Use 'jf c add' to configure your server IP and authentication
    4. Create a tmp volume (this is required if running from MacOS due to filesystem limitations).
       RUN: docker volume create --driver local --opt type=tmpfs --opt device=tmpfs --opt o=size=30000m,mode=1777 yoctotmp
    5. RUN: docker run --rm -it \
                   -v [YOCTO_WORKSPACE_LOCAL_FOLDER]:/home/build/workspace \
                   -v [USER_HOMEDIR]/.jfrog:/home/build/.frog \
                   -v yoctotmp:/home/build/workspace/build/tmp \
                    jfrog-yocto-builder bake core-image-minimal

## Installation with JFrog CLI
Installing the latest version:

`$ jf plugin install jfrog-yocto`

Installing a specific version:

`$ jf plugin install jfrog-yocto@version`

Uninstalling a plugin

`$ jf plugin uninstall jfrog-yocto`

## Usage
### Commands
* configure
    - Used to configure the artifactory instance connection details. 
      This is an interactive command.
* bake
    - Used to build/deploy your yocto firmware 
    - Arguments:
        - target - The bake target. Examples: core-image-base, core-image-minimal
    - Flags:
        - run-folder - The location of the root folder to run the process from. **[Default: curr directory]**
        - build-env - The name of the "oe-init-build-env" to init the build env from. **[Default: oe-init-build-env]**
        - clean: Clean before the build, and clean the build-info on start **[Default: true]**
        - build: Perform a build. should be true unless you want to bypass and manually build **[Default: true]**
        - load: Load the resulting build to artifactory **[Default: true]**
        - scan: Scan the result with Xray **[Default: false]**
        - repo: Target repository to deploy to **[Default: yocto]**
        - artifact-name: Target name to deploy on
        - build-name: The name of the build
        - build-num: The number of the build
        - only-images: Deploy only the images of the build. **[Default: true]**
        - art-id: The server ID for artifactory configuration **[Default: using default config]**
            
    - Example:
    ```
  $ jf jfrog-yocto bake core-image-minimal
  
    Running pre steps. Running directory=./
    Running Bit bake. target=core-image-minimal. This may take a long time....
    Loading the result to Artifactory

  ```
